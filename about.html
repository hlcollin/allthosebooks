    <h1>WHAT IS THIS?</h1>
    <h3>WHO MADE IT?</h3>  
    <p>Heather Collins, a fourth year Graphic Communication major at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, was sitting in the <a href=“http://www.grc.calpoly.edu/special-collections/rjpgac”>RJPGAC Resource Room</a> killing time before her Printed Electronics lab. She noticed all the books on the shelves and realized that she had no idea what was inside them. Breaking millennial protocol, she closed her laptop and grabbed a Penrose Annual from the shelf. The contents were astoundingly beautiful. Newly enlightened with this experience, she decided to center her senior project around exploring and sharing the contents of &ldquo;all those books&rdquo; in the Resource Room. </p>
    <p>This site was developed to celebrate the rich and interesting history of graphic communication by gathering together images found inside forgotten graphic art yearbooks from the twentieth century. It is a reminder that as part of the graphic communication industry, we are forever connected with typefounders, photographers, and bookbinders of old, and share with them the legacy of graphic communication and its expansion from letterpress to a web page like this one.</p>
